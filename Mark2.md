#### Who:
Batman is a man by the name of Bruce Wayne.
Batman is different from most superheroes because, although he has
incredible strength and durability, he does **not** actually have any 
superpowers.

#### Childhood:
Bruce Wayne was part of a very wealthy family. He was orphaned as a 
child due to a thief that held his parents at gunpoint and ultimately 
ended up pulling the trigger. 

Afterwards, Bruce lived a dark, isolated life, resorting to the shadows. He held 
a grudge and used it as fuel to fight for vengeance.

#### Abilities:
Below is a list of Batman's abilities:

* Genius-level intellect
* Expert detective
* Skilled martial artist
* Utilizing high-tech equipment
* Mass amounts of money
* Access to 'BatCave'
